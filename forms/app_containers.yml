- reference: .cloud_controller.allow_app_ssh_access
  label: Allow SSH access to app containers
  description: |
    If you are using a load balancer instead of HAProxy, to enable SSH
    traffic ensure that your load balancer has port 2222 open. PCF users can
    give SSH access to an app only if an admin assigns them a Space Developer
    role in the space that the app runs in. Admins can grant this role in
    Apps Manager or via the cf CLI.

- reference: .cloud_controller.default_app_ssh_access
  label: Enable SSH when an app is created
  description: |
    When enabled and the space has SSH enabled, a new app will have SSH
    enabled. Turning this feature off will disable SSH for new apps but allow
    developers to enable it when necessary.
